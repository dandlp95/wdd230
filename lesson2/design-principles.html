                As soon as the website opens, we can immediately how easy it is to see what they sell and purchase something. The main screen consists of big pictures of their hottest action figures, and if you hover the  mouse over those pictures, you’ll realize you can click on them which makes it very easy to go browse whatever action figures they are advertising the most that week. This is a great example of Fitt’s law which state that the bigger and closer an option is, the easier it will be to access it.

                Netflix main website has a very simple, yet efficient design. Assuming  you are not logged  in your account, there is not a lot you can do other than typing in your email address to create a  Netflix account. This is efficient because it does not leave the prospective clients with much choice other than either closing the tab or creating an account. There is nothing distracting users from joining their service. This complies with Hick’s law which states that the less stimuli there is, the easier it will be for the person to make a decision. If you bombard users with multiple choices to do, they will become distracted from what you want them to do.

                The first thing we see when we open the website, is this very big picture that stretches throughout the screen. The picture is a high resolution image of a person using a tablet. This is what gets our attention first. Right after, we will look at letters on the left side of the screen where we’ll see the name of the product, a brief appealing description, and finally a button that gives us the option to purchase, in that exact order. The order in which we notice all these elements is not a coincidence. They make certain elements stand out over others, so we notice them first. This is visual heriarchy. A design principle that states that we can make certain elements stand out over others by manipulating things like color, padding, size, contract, etc.
