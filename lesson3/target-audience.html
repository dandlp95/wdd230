                <li>A group of freshmen college students are trying to figure out what outdoor activities they can do in a snowy
                    evening in Rexburg. 
                </li>
                <li>After finally getting a day off, a busy person makes plans to go fishing. It is super rainy that day, so he wants 
                    to come up with a new plan, so that day is not wasted. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    A couple makes plans to stay home watching Netflix because they saw in the weather channel there would be a storm
                    that day. Surprinsingly, it is very nice and sunny outside, so they decide to improve outdoor activities instead. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    An Elementary teacher decides to plan to take the kids on a trip some time. However, she wants to plan for every 
                    possible scenario. Sure, it's Spring, but you never know!
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is sunny outside, but someone in a group of friends hates outdoor activities. They want to come up with some indoor
                    activities they can do in the area.
